# Splunk Dashboards – Driving Operational Transparency

## Context  
In multiple enterprise environments, I leveraged Splunk to build dashboards that provided leaders with real-time visibility into program health, vendor performance, and resource allocation. These dashboards were critical in improving decision-making speed and accuracy.  

## My Role  
As Program Manager, I collaborated with engineering, finance, and operations teams to define reporting needs, identify data sources, and build dashboards that aligned delivery metrics with business KPIs.  

## Key Dashboard Examples  

- **Spend Visibility Dashboard**  
  - Tracked budget vs. actuals across vendors and initiatives.  
  - Enabled finance leaders to forecast more accurately and spot cost overruns early.  

- **Vendor Allocation Dashboard**  
  - Visualized vendor resource usage across projects.  
  - Helped procurement and PMO teams optimize resource utilization and avoid bottlenecks.  

- **Resource Utilization Dashboard**  
  - Provided a real-time view of team bandwidth and workload distribution.  
  - Supported capacity planning and reduced delivery delays.  

## Outcome  
By maintaining 15+ Splunk dashboards, I enhanced executive reporting efficiency and improved forecast precision by ~20%. These dashboards ensured stakeholders had a “single source of truth” to monitor program execution and align on next steps.
