# Governance Playbook – Scaling Programs at Facebook Data Centers

## Context  
At Facebook, I was responsible for ensuring execution rigor and transparency across large-scale infrastructure programs supporting global data center expansion. These initiatives required strong governance to align engineering, operations, and business stakeholders across multiple geographies.  

## My Role  
As a Technical Program Manager, I introduced governance structures that standardized execution, created visibility, and reduced delivery risk on mission-critical programs.  

## Key Elements of the Playbook  

- **Program Intake & Prioritization**  
  - Established clear intake criteria for programs.  
  - Facilitated alignment workshops with stakeholders to define business outcomes and success metrics.  

- **Milestone & Dependency Tracking**  
  - Implemented milestone maps across parallel workstreams (network, compute, facilities, supply chain).  
  - Flagged dependencies early, preventing downstream delivery risks.  

- **Execution Transparency**  
  - Built dashboards to track delivery health (schedule, budget vs. actuals, vendor performance).  
  - Ensured executives had a “single pane of glass” view into program progress.  

- **Decision-Making Cadence**  
  - Created escalation frameworks with pre-set decision owners.  
  - Reduced decision latency by ensuring issues were surfaced with clear options and data.  

- **Post-Mortem & Continuous Improvement**  
  - Conducted retrospectives after major milestones.  
  - Captured learnings into templates/playbooks to accelerate future programs.  

## Outcome  
This governance playbook scaled execution across multiple $50M+ programs, improving delivery predictability, stakeholder alignment, and cross-functional collaboration. It has since served as a repeatable framework for managing complex technical programs.
