# Customer Success Templates – Driving Adoption at Multiscale

## Context  
At Multiscale, I worked directly with Fortune 500 clients deploying AI/ML solutions in procurement and R&D. The technical solutions were powerful, but customer success required structured adoption practices to ensure value realization.  

## My Role  
As Program Leader, I created templates and playbooks to help customers integrate AI/ML into daily workflows, drive adoption, and measure ROI.  

## Key Templates  

- **Executive Alignment Decks**  
  - Standardized presentations to tie AI/ML program outcomes to C-level strategic goals.  
  - Simplified technical complexity into business KPIs for board-level reporting.  

- **Adoption Playbooks**  
  - Step-by-step guides for embedding AI tools into engineering workflows.  
  - Addressed cultural and process barriers to adoption.  

- **ROI Dashboards**  
  - Templates to track procurement savings, R&D acceleration, and de-risking outcomes.  
  - Enabled customers to see measurable impact within 1–2 quarters.  

## Outcome  
By operationalizing customer success, I ensured Multiscale’s deployments moved beyond proofs-of-concept to long-term adoption. These templates accelerated onboarding, improved executive confidence, and positioned Multiscale as a trusted innovation partner.
