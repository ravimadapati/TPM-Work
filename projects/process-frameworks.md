# Process Frameworks – Scaling Execution Across Cisco & Gap Inc.

## Context  
At both Cisco and Gap Inc., I led programs where traditional delivery methods weren’t sufficient. Large-scale transformations required a hybrid execution model that balanced agile speed with enterprise-grade governance.  

## My Role  
As Technical Program Manager, I designed and implemented process frameworks that enabled distributed teams to deliver predictably while adapting to fast-changing priorities.  

## Key Frameworks  

- **Hybrid Agile Delivery (Cisco)**  
  - Introduced sprint-based execution within long-range infrastructure programs.  
  - Balanced iterative delivery for engineering teams with milestone-based reporting for executives.  

- **Enterprise PMO Governance (Gap Inc.)**  
  - Standardized program intake, milestone tracking, and retrospectives.  
  - Ensured cross-functional alignment across finance, store operations, and engineering.  

- **Dependency & Risk Management**  
  - Designed dependency maps across parallel workstreams (cloud, data center, supply chain).  
  - Built proactive risk tracking to surface blockers early and reduce escalation churn.  

## Outcome  
These frameworks improved delivery predictability and transparency across $50M+ portfolios. They became reusable models for scaling execution across global, distributed teams while keeping stakeholders aligned at every level.
