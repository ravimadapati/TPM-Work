Ravi Madapati
Technical Program Leader | Business Operations Strategist | Customer-Centric GTM Architect

Ravi Madapati is a high-agency technical program leader with over 20 years of experience architecting and delivering large-scale transformation programs across top-tier organizations including Meta, Gap Inc., Cisco, and emerging AI/ML startups. His career spans the full arc of enterprise modernizationâ€”from cloud infrastructure and CX platforms to AI-driven analytics and go-to-market strategyâ€”making him a rare bridge between engineering execution, business value, and customer impact.

A builder by instinct, Ravi has stood up global PMO frameworks, driven $50M+ portfolios, and led programs across hybrid and multi-cloud ecosystems. Heâ€™s as comfortable in a sprint retrospective as he is in a boardroom, translating technical complexity into strategic clarity. Whether rolling out network automation at Metaâ€™s hyperscale data centers or modernizing Gapâ€™s store and corporate tech stacks, Ravi brings structured delivery, operational excellence, and measurable outcomes.

At Multiscale, Ravi operated at the intersection of AI deployment and GTM executionâ€”scoping machine learning solutions for Fortune 500 clients, aligning with CFOs and legal teams, and driving customer success across deeply technical implementations. His unique blend of TPM rigor, financial modeling, and stakeholder diplomacy consistently moves programs from ambiguity to adoption.

How I Work

I distill complexity into clarityâ€”turning long-range strategy into near-term execution.

I focus on measurable value: reduced friction, improved ROI, scalable processes.

I lead with trust, align stakeholders early, and thrive where structure meets speed.

I bring a product mindset to program execution, always thinking from the customer backward.
