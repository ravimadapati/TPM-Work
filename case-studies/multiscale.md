# Multiscale – Accelerating AI/ML Adoption in Advanced Manufacturing

## Context  
Multiscale, an AI-driven materials informatics company, partners with Fortune 500 manufacturers to accelerate product innovation and procurement optimization. Clients often faced fragmented workflows and struggled to align AI/ML deployments with tangible business outcomes.  

## My Role  
As Business Development Executive and Program Leader, I owned the end-to-end delivery of strategic AI/ML programs, working directly with client executives, product teams, and engineering leaders to ensure adoption success and measurable ROI.  

## Key Contributions  
- **Program Leadership** – Directed multi-million-dollar AI/ML deployments across semiconductor and advanced materials industries—bridging internal product, data science, and client engineering teams.  
- **Customer Success Focus** – Acted as the primary external-facing program lead for clients, ensuring that success criteria were defined, adoption tracked, and business value delivered.  
- **Executive Engagement** – Worked directly with CIOs, CTOs, and R&D heads to scope programs, align milestones, and provide clear ROI dashboards that tied technical outcomes to strategic priorities.  
- **Cross-Functional Alignment** – Partnered with internal Sales, Product, and Customer Success functions to drive platform adoption and accelerate time-to-value for customers.  
- **Change Enablement** – Led customer workshops and created adoption playbooks to integrate AI/ML workflows into day-to-day engineering practices, overcoming resistance and ensuring long-term stickiness.  

## Outcome  
Multiscale’s programs enabled clients to shorten R&D cycles, cut procurement costs, and de-risk materials selection. By embedding customer success principles into every stage of delivery, I helped transform technical deployments into enduring business impact—strengthening partnerships and positioning Multiscale as a trusted innovation partner.
